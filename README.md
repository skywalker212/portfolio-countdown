# Portfolio Countdown  
A web page that contains some information about when the site is going to be live and a countdown timer.  
It also contains my information and provides a service to send me a mail which I have not implemented completely.  
This site will serve as a placeholder for my portfolio site while I develop the whole site. I had an idea to make a site like this after reading an article on [Medium](www.medium.com). I made this site in a span of one night so there is a possibility of errors.  

I have used the JavaScript for the countdown timer from [this](https://github.com/rendro/countdown) since I didn't want to write the whole countdown script. I have also used [font awesome](www.fontawesome.io) for the social media and GitHub icons.

You can drop me a mail at akashgajjar8@gmail.com for any suggestions or queries.  

Peace
